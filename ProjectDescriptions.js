`This decentralized application (dApp) was built using Hardhat, Solidity,
React, HTML and CSS, allowing users to mint an ERC721 token and stake it 
to earn a reward token daily without a timelock. While these tokens do not have any value,
it does allow users a safe introduction to an aspect of the web3 space. 
The dApp's functionality and user interface were developed with a focus on seamless usability and 
extensive testing of the smart contracts and front-end functionality was
conducted. Agile development strategies were employed throughout the 
project's development, breaking down tasks into sprints and regularly
reviewing and refining the project's goals and requirements. The dApp 
was deployed to the Goerli testnet, demonstrating a proficiency in 
full-stack development and blockchain technology.`

export const projectDescription2=
`
As a self-taught junior software developer, I was eager to challenge myself with a
personal project that would showcase my abilities with PostgreSQL and Javascript.
This led me to create a full-stack CRUD application that allows users to easily 
reference their favorite stickers and purchase them with just one click.By designing 
and implementing a well-structured database, I was able to efficiently store and 
retrieve sticker information using a REST API. This project was not only an opportunity
to demonstrate my proficiency in these technologies but also to further develop
my skills in creating user-friendly interfaces and effective user experiences.I 
am proud to have taken the initiative to develop this project independently, 
as it has greatly contributed to my growth as a software developer. I believe 
this project represents my passion for constantly learning and improving, and
I look forward to continuing to refine my skills through future projects.

export const projectDescription3 = 
`
This personal project was born out of my desire to improve an inefficient and 
time-consuming task at my former job. I noticed that receiving information via email and manually 
typing it into another page was not only tedious but also prone to errors. To 
streamline the process, I developed a scraping application using Python, Flask, 
and Selenium that automated the task, eliminating the need for manual processing 
and reducing processing time. By implementing data cleaning and normalization
techniques, I was able to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data, 
resulting in a more efficient and error-free process. For the sake of learning,
I created a simple database using SQLAlchemy, an ORM (Object Relational Manager),
to manage my data. To store the data, I used SQL and PostgreSQL, which
allowed for easy access and manipulation of the data. This project not only
improved the efficiency of the task but also had a positive impact on my understanding 
of the Flask microframework.
